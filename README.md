# FDS – Lab (Fundamentals of Data Science)

This repository contains lab experiments that cover the fundamentals of Data Science, starting from Python basics to advanced analytics techniques.

## Experiments

### Expt 1 – Basic Python Operations  
Covers Python basics with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn as the foundation for Data Science and AI.  

### Expt 2 – Titanic Survival Dataset (Data Science Life Cycle)  
Applies the complete data science workflow—data collection, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and evaluation—on the Titanic dataset.  

### Expt 3 – Descriptive Analytics  
Focuses on summarizing data using measures of central tendency, dispersion, frequency distribution, and visualization.  

### Expt 4 – Diagnostic Analysis  
Explores relationships between variables to understand why certain outcomes occurred through correlations and patterns.  

### Expt 5 – Predictive Analysis  
Uses machine learning models to predict future outcomes based on historical data patterns.  

### Expt 6 – Prescriptive Analytics  
Goes beyond prediction to recommend optimal actions and decision-making strategies using analytics and AI.
